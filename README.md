# Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize different hand gestures from images. This can be used for various applications like gesture-based control systems, sign language translation, and interactive systems.

## Overview
The project aims to classify hand gestures into predefined categories using deep learning. A CNN is trained on a dataset of labeled hand gesture images to learn the distinctive features of each gesture.

## Dataset
You can use any hand gesture image dataset. One popular option is the [Kaggle Hand Gesture Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Ensure the dataset is organized into folders where each folder represents a unique gesture class.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hand-gesture-recognition
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Make sure TensorFlow or PyTorch, depending on your implementation, is included in the `requirements.txt`)*

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset and place it in a `data` folder.
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Test the model on new images:
   ```bash
   python test.py --image_path <path_to_image>
   ```

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract and learn features from gesture images. The final layers are dense layers with softmax activation for classification.

## Results
The model achieves a reasonable accuracy on the test set, showing effective classification of gestures. Fine-tuning can improve performance based on the dataset and use case.
